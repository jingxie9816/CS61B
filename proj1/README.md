Hi there 👋

In this project, I built the implementations of a “Double Ended Queue”(Deque) using both lists and arrays in a package that other classes can use.

Here is a definition for Deque from [cplusplus.com](cplusplus.com).

> Deque (usually pronounced like “deck”) is an irregular acronym of double-ended queue. 
> Double-ended queues are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contracted on both ends (either its front or its back).


I created two Java files: `LinkedListDeque.java` and `ArrayDeque.java` so the class `Deque` can be used for both lists and arrays respectively.
It has public methods listed below:

**addFirst(T item)**  
**addLast(T item)**  
**isEmpty()**  
**size()   
printDeque()   
removeFirst()  
removeLast()  
get(int index)  
equals(Object o)**
